To run this program:
Ensure makefile is in the same folder as your source code.
Open two windows, one designated for client and the other designated for server.
Run 'make client' on one and 'make server' on the other to compile the code.
After compiling, run 'make run_client' on the client window and 'make run_server' on the server window.
Enter the corresponding IP adresses, pick a port that will be the same for both, and enter your desired parameters.

Have fun!
